# Tech Stack Document

This document explains the key technologies behind our Vite-Tailwind-TypeScript-Supabase-Shadcn UI starter kit. It’s written in everyday language so that anyone—technical or non-technical—can understand why we chose each tool and how they work together.

## Frontend Technologies

- **Vite**  
  A lightning-fast build tool and local server that starts in milliseconds. It gives developers instant feedback via hot module replacement and produces optimized bundles for production.

- **React with TypeScript**  
  React provides a component-based structure for building UIs. TypeScript adds static types, catching errors early and making the code easier to navigate.

- **Tailwind CSS**  
  A utility-first styling framework. Instead of writing custom CSS, you compose prebuilt classes directly in your markup. This speeds up styling and ensures consistency across components.

- **Shadcn UI**  
  A library of accessible, customizable UI primitives that work seamlessly with Tailwind CSS. It offers ready-made components (like sidebars, modals, buttons) following modern design patterns.

- **Vitest**  
  A Vite-native testing framework. It runs unit tests quickly in the same environment as your app, making it easy to verify component behavior.

## Backend Technologies

- **Supabase Database**  
  A managed Postgres database in the cloud. We’ve configured a single “projects” table and included a seed script so you see example data right away.

- **Supabase Client Library**  
  A set of JavaScript functions for interacting with your database. It handles fetching, inserting, updating, and deleting records, plus real-time subscriptions if you need them later.

- **Seed Data Script**  
  A simple script that loads example rows into the “projects” table. This makes the Projects Management page feel functional immediately.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

- **Version Control (Git & GitHub)**  
  All source code lives in a GitHub repository for collaboration, code review, and history tracking.

- **CI/CD (GitHub Actions)**  
  Automated workflows run linting, tests, and builds on every push or pull request. This ensures code quality before merging or deploying.

- **Hosting Platforms (Vercel or Netlify)**  
  Zero-config hosting for static frontends and serverless functions, with instant previews for pull requests.

- **Development Tooling**
  - **ESLint**: Enforces a consistent code style and catches potential issues.
  - **Prettier**: Auto-formats code so everyone’s files look the same.
  - **.env Management**: An `.env.example` file lists required environment variables, making setup straightforward.

## Third-Party Integrations

- **Clerk.com**  
  Provides hosted authentication (sign-up/sign-in) pages and session management. We’ve enabled Google as the only social login provider to keep onboarding simple.

- **Lead-Capture Form**  
  A newsletter or waitlist sign-up form on the marketing page. It’s ready to connect to email platforms like Mailchimp or ConvertKit.

- **Analytics Tracking**  
  Space in the landing page template to drop in tools such as Google Analytics or Plausible for monitoring visitor behavior.

## Security and Performance Considerations

- **Authentication Security**  
  Clerk handles password storage, token management, and session security so you don’t have to reinvent the wheel.

- **Database Security**  
  Supabase’s row-level security (RLS) ensures only authenticated users can read or modify their own data.

- **Type Safety**  
  TypeScript prevents many runtime errors by catching mismatched types during development.

- **CSS Optimization**  
  Tailwind’s purge feature removes unused styles in production, keeping CSS bundles small.

- **Fast Builds & Dev Experience**  
  Vite’s dev server and build optimizations ensure quick feedback loops for developers and fast load times for users.

## Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

This starter kit blends modern, proven tools to give builders a solid foundation:

- **Frontend**: Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI + Vitest
- **Backend**: Supabase database & client library + seed data script
- **Authentication**: Clerk with Google login
- **Tooling**: ESLint, Prettier, GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- **Hosting**: Vercel or Netlify with simple environment setup

Together, these technologies provide a smooth developer experience, a fast and responsive UI, and a secure, scalable backend—ready for you to customize and build upon.
