# Premium Features: UI/UX Design Guidelines

## Access Points for Premium Features

We'll implement a hybrid approach to premium feature access, based on feature complexity and usage frequency:

1. **Sidebar Navigation Items**
   - For major standalone premium features (e.g., "Analytics Dashboard", "Team Management")
   - Will appear in the main sidebar navigation after standard features
   - Benefits: High visibility, clear separation from free features

2. **Contextual Tabs**
   - For premium features that enhance existing views (e.g., "Advanced Filters" tab in Projects view)
   - Implemented as additional tabs within existing page layouts
   - Benefits: Maintains context, logical feature grouping

3. **Feature Panels in Settings**
   - For configuration-heavy premium features (e.g., "Custom Fields", "Workflow Rules")
   - Accessed through a dedicated "Premium Settings" section
   - Benefits: Centralized management, doesn't clutter main UI

## Visual Distinction for Premium Features

To clearly indicate premium status without compromising the user experience:

1. **Premium Badges**
   - Small purple crown or star icon with "Premium" label
   - Applied to sidebar items, tabs, and settings entries
   - Subtle but recognizable across the application

2. **Locked State Representation**
   - For free users, premium features appear with a subtle lock icon
   - On hover/click, shows upgrade prompt with feature benefits
   - Example: Grayed-out tab with lock icon that reveals upgrade modal

3. **Premium Section**
   - Dedicated "Premium Features" section in sidebar (for free users)
   - Contains previews of available premium features
   - Clear "Upgrade" button with pricing information

## Implementation Examples

### Sidebar Navigation Example
```tsx
<SidebarNavItem>
  <span>Projects</span> {/* Standard feature */}
</SidebarNavItem>

<SidebarNavItem>
  <span>Analytics</span>
  <PremiumBadge /> {/* Premium feature indicator */}
</SidebarNavItem>
```

### Contextual Tabs Example
```tsx
<Tabs defaultValue="basic">
  <TabsList>
    <TabsTrigger value="basic">Basic View</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="advanced" disabled={!isPremiumUser}>
      Advanced View
      {!isPremiumUser && <LockIcon className="ml-1 h-4 w-4" />}
    </TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>
  
  <TabsContent value="basic">
    {/* Basic view content */}
  </TabsContent>
  
  <TabsContent value="advanced">
    {isPremiumUser ? (
      /* Premium feature content */ 
    ) : (
      <UpgradePrompt feature="advanced-view" />
    )}
  </TabsContent>
</Tabs>
```

### Settings Panel Example
```tsx
<SettingsSection>
  <SettingsHeader>General Settings</SettingsHeader>
  {/* Regular settings */}
  
  <SettingsHeader>
    Premium Settings
    <PremiumBadge />
  </SettingsHeader>
  
  {isPremiumUser ? (
    /* Premium settings options */
  ) : (
    <PremiumSettingsPlaceholder onUpgradeClick={handleUpgradeModal} />
  )}
</SettingsSection>
```

## Progressive Enhancement Strategy

For a smooth upgrade path:

1. **Always visible, but locked:** Premium features are always visible in the UI but indicated as premium/locked for free users
2. **Preview capabilities:** Allow free users to see what they're missing with read-only previews where appropriate
3. **Contextual upgrading:** Upgrade prompts appear in context of the premium feature the user is trying to access
4. **No UI disruption:** When a user upgrades, the UI remains consistent - locks simply disappear and features become accessible

This approach maintains a cohesive experience while clearly distinguishing premium offerings.
